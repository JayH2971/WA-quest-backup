Message:  1010
<ce>  You see a woman traveling opposite your direction.
<ce>  She hails you, stopping you in the way.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Excuse me %ra, I must ask this of you.
<ce>  I'm no beggar but a mother in distress.
<ce>  I've taken up to deliver some goods to ___place_,
<ce>  leaving my young children at home.
<ce>  It's the only way I can keep us fed.
<ce>  Kind stranger, would you have some money to spare?
<ce>  It hurts to ask, but it tears me to pieces leaving
<ce>  them unattended, to say nothing of the dangers
<ce>  out here in the wild. I could return home right now
<ce>  and live a whole week with just 150 coins. I have
<ce>  nothing to reward you with, other than eternal gratitude."

Message:  1011
<ce>  Tears come to her eyes. "I suppose we all have our
<ce>  hardships. %god bless both of us to get
<ce>  where we're going. Goodbye."

Message:  1012
<ce>  She weeps openly and thanks you for your kindness.
<ce>  
<ce>  "%god watch over you, %ra.
<ce>  This means more to me than you could know."
<ce>  
<ce>  She fills a small sack with the coins and departs
<ce>  in a different direction.

Message:  1013
<ce>  You look through your belongings but find you
<ce>  don't have enough money. Before you can say
<ce>  anything else, she interjects.
<ce>  
<ce>  "You know what? I'm so sorry that I asked you
<ce>  this. It's clear we're all going through hard times.
<ce>  %god bless both of us to get
<ce>  where we're going. Goodbye."
