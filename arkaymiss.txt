<ce>            "Thank you. I'll be safe from here."
<ce>   
<ce>   _name_ gives you the payment as promised.

Message:  1010
<ce>         You barely notice a priest nearby,
<ce>  whose meditations seem to radiate peace.
<ce>  A hand wave follows.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Hello child! Would you like to hear of Arkay,
<ce>  god of life and death?"

Message:  1011
<ce>  "Ah, 'tis a surprise to see one in the prime of life,
<ce>  brimming with adventuresome spirit, take time to 
<ce>  learn of the divine. A welcome surprise, I should say.
<ce>  Come. We have much to discuss concerning Arkay the Great!"
<ce>  
<ce>  This missionary seems quite determined to talk to you.
<ce>  Do you accept?

Message:  1012
<ce>  "Well now, you're serious about this indeed.
<ce>  Where shall we begin? To speak of Arkay is to speak
<ce>  of the balance between death and life -- the very
<ce>  god who keeps these two primal forces in balance.
<ce>  Were our eyes a little sharper, my friend, we would..."
<ce>  
<ce>  The lecture continues on in this vein for some time.
<ce>  
<ce>  "But it would be silly to speak merely of the divine or
<ce>  the metaphysical without coming to the question,
<ce>  'And what's in it for me?' Let's turn it to you, then.
<ce>  Tell me, do you fear death?"

Message:  1013
<ce>  "Your honesty is good, my child. Work hard to overcome that fear.
<ce>  One day death will claim you. Be ready for that day!
<ce>  Arkay the Great is supreme above this whole sphere, and
<ce>  we need not fear! Now, my friend, I must soon depart, 
<ce>  but let us commune with Arkay together. Come now."
<ce>  
<ce>  The two of you spend several quiet moments contemplating
<ce>  these words. You feel your affinity for the god Arkay has grown.
<ce>  
<ce>  The missionary embraces you and departs,
<ce>  happy to have accomplished a good deed for the day.

Message:  1014
<ce>  "That is good. Be ready for it all! Give your whole heart
<ce>  to your purpose, keep nothing back! When death claims you,
<ce>  let it take all, body and heart! Why, there is nothing at all
<ce>  to fear in death! Arkay the Great is wondrous.
<ce>  Now, my friend, I must soon depart, but let us commune with
<ce>  Arkay together. Come now."

Message:  1015

<ce>  Safe travels!"
