<ce>     You draw closer and push some of the people out of the way.
<ce>         Once you've begun stitching, the task's true nature
<ce>      quickly becomes apparent, as this is no mere flesh wound.
<ce>         Hemorrhaging increases, and the patient soon faints.
<ce>      Once the bystanders realize you are not fit for this work
<ce>         they push you aside and carry the injured to someone
<ce>                     more capable to do the job.

<ce>     You step forward and reduce circulation to the wounded area
<ce>      with one cloth while instructing some of the bystanders to
<ce> prepare some antiseptic to pour on other bandages. They follow your
<ce>  instructions and, following your lead with stitches, soon have the
<ce>   bleeding entirely under control. A nearby family member breathes
<ce>       a deep sigh of relief and offers you a small reward for
<ce>                    your kindness and dedication.

Message:  1010
<ce>    You notice a crowd gathered up nearby. Someone has apparently
<ce>   fallen with a gaping wound that bleed profusely onto the ground.
<ce>       Various townsfolk nearby attempt to cover it with cloths
<ce>       which turn red and damp. Will you try to intervene with
<ce>                       your medical knowledge?

<ce>        Finding no hope in sight, they pick up the peasant and
<ce>      carry him off to some other place. Hopefully he will find
<ce>          someone to suture the wound before it's too late.
