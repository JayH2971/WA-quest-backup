<ce> You see a statue in the distance. As the moonlight shines
<ce> against the stone surface, it crumbles into pieces.
<--->
<ce> A set of statues in the distance shimmer in the night.
<ce> You can't shake the feeling that they are alive. 
<--->
<ce> The red eyes of a statue beam from the darkness.
<ce> This is no ordinary statue...
<--->
<ce> You find yourself in a place with some curiously placed
<ce> stone statues. It almost feels like something
<ce> is watching you.
