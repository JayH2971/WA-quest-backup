<ce> "How goes it? If you feel like you are up to the 
<ce> task, you should join the Fighters Guild. They
<ce> provided me with plenty of work, and benefits."
<--->

<ce> It looks as if they are looking for someone.
<--->
<ce> "Got a Giant problem? You should seek out the Fighters 
<ce> Guild. We specialize in that sort of thing."
<--->
<ce> "Get away from me you vermin."
<ce>

<ce> Apprentice of the Fighters Guild.

<ce>
<ce> Attempt robbery?
<--->
<ce> "I've seen rats more deadlier that you!"
<ce>

<--->
<ce> "You are more of a fool than you look!"
<--->
<ce> "You leave me no choice."
<--->
<ce> "You call that a threat? I'll show you
<ce> what a real threat looks like!"
<--->
<ce> "Pity. Maybe %ln will reward me
<ce> greatly for exterminating scum like you."
<--->
<ce> "I've fought the best of Tamriel !
<ce> No way a street thug like you has any chance
<ce> against the likes of me!"
<--->
<ce> "Who sent you? The Thieves Guild? No...
<ce> I'd never picture a come to life Imp's
<ce> excrement such as yourself to even have
<ce> that much honor."
<--->
<ce> "HA! You humor me. You want to be killed?

<ce> %pcn was it? I've been hired by the Fighter's Guild to find you.

Message: 2012
<ce> "My job was to bring you here. The Fighters Guild has an offer 
<ce> for you. One that would be in your very best interest.
<ce> A Fighter's Guild representative is inside waiting to speak
<ce> with you."

Message: 2013
<ce> "How goes it? You might be confused as to why I 
<ce> had you brought here. I'll keep it brief. You see,
<ce> we found information regarding your, well, "Associates".
<ce> The Fighters Guild were hired to take you in.
<ce> Be it dead or alive. However, at least for me,
<ce> I'd rather not spill blood. We don't kill 
<ce> unless we have to. If we were as cold blooded
<ce> we'd be no better than the Dark brotherhood.
<ce> I have a request. Something that might interest you.
<ce> However, that means changes have to be made.
<ce> Are you interested?"

Message: 3000
<ce> "Very well, here's the deal. Cut ties with all
<ce> the criminals you are associated with. Every last 
<ce> one. In return, we will restore credibility to you 
<ce> in this region. From here on out, you are free
<ce> from those criminal organizations and you can 
<ce> live an honest life. Help people. Better yourself.
<ce> I'll let you know now. The underworld will not 
<ce> be happy about it. It will be a dangerous choice
<ce> but if I'll have any say in it, the Fighters Guild 
<ce> will help protect you if we can. It's a difficult
<ce> choice. Take your time."
<ce>
<ce> Cut ties with the underworld?

Message: 3001
<ce> "I understand. The choice is not an easy one.
<ce> The dangers of leaving a criminal past is massive.
<ce> I can't guarantee you that future contracts 
<ce> to hunt you won't come up but after this conversation
<ce> I've had with you, I can only feel there is still
<ce> hope left for you. You came all the way out here, 
<ce> traversed this monster filled cave, and you still 
<ce> listened to what I had to say. I expected worse 
<ce> from someone with so many dirty associations. 
<ce> I will pray to %god that one day you may
<ce> very well change your ways."

Message: 3002
<ce> "Excellent! From here on out, consider yourself clean.
<ce> Free to do as you please. I will not tell you how to 
<ce> live your life, but life after abruptly cutting ties
<ce> with those factions isn't an easy one. You might
<ce> have to change your identity, go into hiding, and 
<ce> maybe even live a new life. If not, perhaps you could 
<ce> join the Fighters Guild? The place is like family to me.
<ce> I have no doubt they'll accept you too. Whatever you 
<ce> decide, stay safe on your travels."

Message: 3003
<ce> Try to pacify the fighters guild agent?
<ce>
<ce> (Etiquette)

Message: 3004
<ce> "Hey! Where do you think you are going?
<ce> If you won't come willingly, then 
<ce> we have no other option here! Have at you!"

Message: 3005
<ce> "You there! I must speak with you. My name is 
<ce> Sir %ln. I'm a traveling Knight looking 
<ce> for the greatest warriors of the land. You see
<ce> I've fought my entire life, and with every 
<ce> battle I wanted to die a warriors death.
<ce> Some might see it as a blessing to live another
<ce> day but, I rather go out in battle than to die of 
<ce> old age in some cottage. The only thing 
<ce> I have left is my love for battle. I'll get 
<ce> straight to the point. I would like to duel you 
<ce> to the death. You seem to be a capable warrior 
<ce> yourself. Please, may you give me this chance
<ce> to die with honor."
<ce>
<ce> Fight the knight to the death?

Message: 3006
<ce> "Thank you! May our battle be legendary!"

Message: 3007
<ce> Very well. Perhaps I will find another warrior 
<ce> on my travels. Have a safe journey, friend. 

Message: 3008
<ce> As you strike him down, the knight takes their final 
<ce> breath. With a smile, they pass onto the afterlife.

Message: 3009
<ce> You manged to steal from the warrior.

Message: 3010
<ce> "Greetings! My name is Sir %ln. I'm a traveling 
<ce> Knight looking for the greatest warriors of the land. 
<ce> You see I've fought my entire life, and with every 
<ce> battle I wanted to die a warriors death.
<ce> Some might see it as a blessing to live another
<ce> day but, I rather go out in battle than to die of 
<ce> old age in some cottage. The only thing 
<ce> I have left is my love for battle."
<ce> 
<ce> He gives you a sharp look up and down.
<ce>
<ce> "Hmmm perhaps you are not ready for such a challenge.
<ce> May we cross paths again when you are prepared."
