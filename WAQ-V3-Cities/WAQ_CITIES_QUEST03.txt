QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>               You make good time and form a large pile
<ce>               of usable firewood. When time runs out,
<ce>             you look at the other competitors and notice
<ce>              one in particular has much more split wood
<ce>                 than any other, including yourself.
<ce>              You leave without the prize. Perhaps your
<ce>              axe skills leave something to be desired.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>            You cleave log after log, splitting them with
<ce>              expert precision and confidence. Your work
<ce>             with axes shines clearly in this competition
<ce>            and garners some admiration from the watching
<ce>             townspeople. When time is called, your pile
<ce>              clearly has an advantage over that of your
<ce>            fellow competitors. You are granted the prize.

Message:  1010
<ce>              The citizens of the town have gathered to
<ce>             run a charitable contest intended to produce
<ce>        firewood for some of the local widows. Competitors are
<ce>        each given a wood axe and access to a supply of logs,
<ce>          and for several minutes all will work furiously to
<ce>      build the biggest firewood pile. A reward of =reward_ gold
<ce>    pieces is provided as incentive. Do you want to take a place?

Message:  1012
<ce>           The good spirits and gratitude of the crowd are
<ce>            heartwarming but not enough to earn your time.
<ce>                   You leave them to their contest.
