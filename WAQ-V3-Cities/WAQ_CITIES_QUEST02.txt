<ce> You and your opponent square up and begin to
<ce> fight once the signal is given. You trade blows
<ce> rather equally, neither one gaining a real
<ce> advantage over the other. After several minutes
<ce> the crowd grows restless and you are both ejected
<ce> in favor of more skilled combatants.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce> You make a ready stance before your opponent.
<ce> The right opportunity comes seconds after the
<ce> fight starts. You wheel back and lunge forward
<ce> with a haymaker that sends the other fighter to the
<ce> ground. You shake hands afterwards to reassure the
<ce> startled crowd and the officiator gives you
<ce> your well-earned prize.

Message:  1010
<ce> A crowd has gathered to watch fisticuff matches
<ce> among the local citizenry. The organizer carries
<ce> several sacks of money which are destined for
<ce> the winners of each match. It looks like the
<ce> next round is about to start and an opponent has
<ce> volunteered. Do you want to try your hand?

Message:  1012
<ce> Surely if violence is called for, it would be to more
<ce> fulfilling ends than this. You depart from the crowd.
