<ce>  The adversary is dead. The Argonian can barely speak but 
<ce>  beckons for you to come closer. Nearby spectators begin to apply
<ce>  bandages to his wounds. He croaks to you with labored breaths.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Our people are not welcome here. Why must we suffer
<ce>  this violence? I beg you, take this before the guard comes.
<ce>  I cannot be found with it."
<ce>  
<ce>  He hands you a small bag before relenting to the villagers' grasp,
<ce>  carrying him away to an inn to recuperate from his wounds.

Message:  1010
<ce>  You become aware of a struggle nearby pertaining
<ce>  to a rare sight: an Argonian has met with a strident racist.
<ce>  
<ce>  "%oth! Go back to the marshes, lizard-freak!"
<ce>  
<ce>  The aggressor clearly has the upper hand and shows no signs
<ce>  of stopping. Will you intervene to stop the attack?

Message:  1011
<ce>  You shout for the fight to stop, but only attract it toward yourself.
<ce>  The rogue was in no mood for an interruption.

Message:  1020
<ce>  The savage beating continues for more than a minute. A few timid
<ce>  passersby contemplate saying something or alerting the guard,
<ce>  but no one summons up the courage. The rogue's wrath is eventually
<ce>  sated and he leaves the Argonian's corpse to bleed out.
<ce>  
<ce>  You notice that a considerable amount of money came spilling out
<ce>  from the victim's pockets during the attack. Will you take advantage
<ce>  of the situation to fill your coin bag?

Message:  1021
<ce>  You discreetly gather up what you can, avoiding the villagers'
<ce>  wandering gazes. Hopefully someone else can donate to take
<ce>  the victim to the inn when you're done.

Message:  1022
<ce>  Surely this poor fellow has suffered enough for one day.
<ce>  You leave the money where it is.
