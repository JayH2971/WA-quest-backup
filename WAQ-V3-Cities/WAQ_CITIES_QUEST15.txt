<ce> You approach and offer to help. He is elated to hear from
<ce> an expert, but your explanations offer more confusion
<ce> than clarity. You mistake one rune for another and
<ce> several words come out improperly. He notices your
<ce> lack of expertise and is quick to retract his request,
<ce> knowing that incompetent help can damage more than
<ce> no help at all. He politely excuses himself and departs.

<ce> You approach and begin to read the required document with
<ce> considerable ease. Together you work out its general meaning
<ce> and what his response should be. His relief is visible.

<ce> "Oh %ra, you cannot imagine the joy I feel having found you!
<ce> I worried that I would be held in contempt for taking on an
<ce> assignment I could not carry honorably. Please, tell me your
<ce> name. I will add you as a co-author to the work and we will both
<ce> be credited in the eyes of the Mages Guild. How does that sound?
<ce> I have no material reward, but surely one so skilled in the arcane
<ce> as yourself can see the value of the Guild's esteem."
<ce> 
<ce> With no other reward forthcoming, you accept it as compensation
<ce> for your time and wish him luck on the way back.

Message:  1010
<ce> From afar you see a robed figure asking passersby for help.
<ce> You piece together the conversation as such:
<ce> 
<ce> "Excuse me! I know this is a long shot, but do you have
<ce> any knowledge of the Daedric language? I have an urgent
<ce> assignment with the Mages Guild that requires an expert.
<ce> And you? Can you help me?"
<ce> 
<ce> If you're confident in your skill, you could offer to help.

Message:  1012
<ce> After attempting to speak to a few others, the mage's shoulders
<ce> slump, disconsolate. It appears he will fail the assignment after all.
<ce> He soon walks away to his inevitable fate.
