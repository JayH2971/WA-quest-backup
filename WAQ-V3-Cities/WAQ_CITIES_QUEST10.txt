QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>       What seemed like a simple game becomes complex once the
<ce>       club touches your hand. Its odd weight and shape make a
<ce>     solid hit very difficult. The gamesman tosses the ball five
<ce>       times, eliciting five misses. While you fail to earn the
<ce>       prize, the only penalty you suffer is the mockery of the
<ce>       small crowd that stopped to watch you. Surely some more
<ce>           practice with clubs and hammers will prepare you
<ce>                            for a rematch.

<ce>         Your experience with blunt weaponry serves you well.
<ce>         The club is weighted oddly, probably on purpose, but
<ce>          you quickly gain your bearings and strike the ball
<ce>           into the air. The smattering of townspeople who
<ce>           stopped to watch you stare as it flies uncounted
<ce>         meters across the sky. The game owner grumbles a bit
<ce>            about cheaters while counting out your reward.

Message:  1010
<ce>          Someone has set up an attraction nearby, gathering
<ce>           a small crowd together to try to hit a ball with
<ce>          a large wooden club. A few people make the attempt
<ce>           and all fail. The owner shouts that whoever can
<ce>            hit the ball further than ten meters will win
<ce>                =reward_ gold pieces. Will you try it?

Message:  1012
<ce>             With so much to do in %crn, you have no time
<ce>           to waste. You leave the games to the townsfolk.
