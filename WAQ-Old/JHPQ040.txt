<ce>              Nearby townsfolk murmur among themselves,
<ce>             claiming they have heard this fellow attack

<ce>          A puff of smoke nearby signals someone's dramatic
<ce>        entrance. You see a man cowled in white, baggy scraps,
<ce>        his face entirely covered. He shouts to the passersby.
<ce>
<ce>            "Ho! Behold, the Spider Master strikes again!
<ce>                 Fall before my might! Minions, go!"
<ce>
<ce>            He snaps his fingers and a pair of beady-eyed
<ce>            spiders clamber out from nearby smoke clouds.
<ce>           The man cackles as he disappears into thin air,
<ce>          leaving his creatures to terrorize the settlement.
