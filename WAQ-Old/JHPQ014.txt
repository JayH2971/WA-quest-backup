Message:  1010
<ce>  "Give me back my _gem_! Right now!"
<ce>  
<ce>  Someone is rapidly approaching, armed and furious.
<ce>  You know you've done nothing wrong here.
<--->
<ce>  "%ra! Get back here, you thief!"
<ce>  
<ce>  It seems you've been falsely accused by
<ce>  someone in no mood for civilized discussion.

<ce>  "But... my family..."
<ce>  
<ce> Your accuser dead, the witnesses nearby murmur among
<ce> themselves. With little effort they agree that you
<ce> acted in self-defense and were justified. The crowd
<ce> soon disperses without raising the alarm.

Message:  1020
<ce> For some this might have been a difficult situation,
<ce> but for one of your speaking ability it is child's play.
<ce> You concisely and simply explain where you have been
<ce> for the last few hours, which is enough to convince
<ce> your accuser of your innocence. After some sincere
<ce> apologies you are left alone.
