<ce>  "Ah, I see you're working well with
<ce>  _appa_. Isn't death a remarkable
<ce>  power? You can practically close your eyes
<ce>  and let %g2 do all the work. Let me see the
<ce>  papers you took from the Mages Guild.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Yes, this statement is of superb quality.
<ce>  I may have to invoke the scholar later
<ce>  to follow up on some of it. For now,
<ce>  I will let you go. As a show of good
<ce>  will, take these _reward_ gold pieces. Never
<ce>  let it be said that the Necromancers
<ce>  do not take care of their own. Now,
<ce>  allow me to free you from my messenger. 
<ce>  
<ce>  "Come away from the %ra, _appa_!
<ce>  I must return you to __graveyard_!"
<ce>  
<ce>  The ghostly presence departs from
<ce>  you, and _necr_ silently
<ce>  hands you your reward.

Message:  1010
<ce> You notice a letter among your
<ce> belongings that wasn't there before,
<ce>  written on very tattered parchment.

Message:  1011
  %ra of ____graveyard_:
 
 We greet you in the name of the King of Worms.
 We take upon ourselves the title of the Necromancers,
 partakers of undying power. We have need of a servant
 capable of moving about the civilized world undetected.
 If you wish to know power beyond that found on this
 mortal coil, turn to __graveyard_ and wait
 for our message there.

Message:  1012
<ce>  Stepping into the graveyard, you feel the
<ce>  wind suddenly whip up in intensity. Dead
<ce>  leaves swirl to lead you to a specific point
<ce>  in the earth. You look toward it and wait.
<ce>  
<ce>  Sensing your presence, some force begins
<ce>  spiralling up and down on the ground,
<ce>  spitting a current of cold air in every direction.
<ce>  A translucent form begins to take shape
<ce>  above the designated point and draws near.
<ce>  A faint voice croaks all around you.
<ce>  
<ce>  "__city_, quickly. A researcher
<ce>  for the Mages Guild. Vital.
<ce>  Slay and obtain letter.
<ce>  I will aid you. With haste."

Message:  1013
<ce>  The apparition hovers closer until it
<ce>  seems to overshadow your head,
<ce>  and then disappears altogether.
<ce>  Somehow you feel it close to you still.

Message:  1014
<ce>  A whisper surrounds your head.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Watch. Mage is near.
<ce>  Search area."

Message:  1015
<ce>  The apparition hisses in your ear.

Message:  1016
<ce>  "Take papers. ___res_.
<ce>  _necr_ awaits."
<ce>  
<ce>  The presence ceases speaking.
<ce>  You take the paperwork from
<ce>  the researcher's corpse.

Message:  1030
%qdt:
 An apparition, doing the bidding
 of the Necromancers, is guiding me
 to __city_ to find a
 scholar from the Mages Guild.
 I must slay him or her and take
 the research he or she carries.

Message:  1031
%qdt:
 The apparition told me to take
 the mage's research to
 ___res_, to an agent
 named _necr_.

Message:  1035
  To _dummy_
  The Mages Guild
  Quarter _num_
 
My research concerning resuscitation magic been
has more draining than any could have imagined.
To search among the people of %crn
for the near-dead and attempt to heal
them to fulness, sometimes failing and sometimes
succeeding, has sapped my will to continue.
I expect to present a short summary of my
activities by the beginning of next year to
the council, that they may consider my proposal
concerning revivification as a circinate spell.
Until that time, have a short statement regarding
my aims and methods. I have coded it once again.
Use cypher C_num_ this time. Please send a month's
worth of living expenses to __city_ in
exchange for this report.
