 I overheard peasants discussing
 ___crypt_, which they say
 is haunted. Many have entered without
 returning to daylight.

 five hundred years ago in mournhold city of gems there lived a
 blind widow woman and her only child a strapping young man he was
 a miner as was his father before him a common laborer in the kings
 mines for his magicka ability was but small the work was honorable
 but poorly paid his mother made and sold small wildenberry cakes in
 the market to help make out their living they did well enough his
 mother said they had enough to fill their bellies no one could wear
 more than one suit of clothing at a time and the roof only leaked
 when it rained symmachus would have liked more he hoped for a lucky
 strike in the mines which would garner him a large bonus in his free
 hours he enjoyed hoisting a glass of ale in the tavern with his friends
 and gambling with them at cards and he drew the eyes and sighs of more
 than one pretty elven girl although none held his interest for long in
 short symmachus was a typical young dark elf man remarkable only for his
 size it was rumored that he had a bit of nord blood in him
