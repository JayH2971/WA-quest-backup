<ce>          My proper %pcf, I believe we have
<ce>          received many meaningful offers for adoption.
<ce>          I believe I have settled on one, and I will take
<ce>          my leave for it, for the time is far spent.
<ce>          I do thank you for your care and wish
<ce>          %god's blessings upon you in your
<ce>          travelings. Farewell, my guardian.

<ce>          You hope you chose well. This decision will

<ce>        A scrawny and dirty child gives you a letter, and
<ce>        then meanders off in a different direction.
<--->
<ce>        "Hello there! I have a letter for %pcn.
<ce>        Is that you? Please take it, my dear."
<ce>        
<ce>        The courier turns and leaves you with the note.

Message:  1011
 To %pcn,
 
 Some rumors in the area speak to your trustworthiness
 and ability to travel in safety. My name is _kid_.
 I am an orphan in formative years, seeking a family who will
 provide me with such experiences as will set the cornerstone
 for a foundation of a good life. If I may rely on your help for this,
 please come to me within =timer_ days, else I will move on.

Message:  1012
<ce>        Ah, my pretended champion, %pcn!
<ce>        You look just like they said. How truly marvelous
<ce>        to meet you in person! And quite a change of
<ce>        pace from the doldrums of this place, the
<ce>        endless monotony of the good people here.
<ce>        True, I've lived off of my inheritance here without
<ce>        issue, but I need something more. Can you
<ce>        help me find a family that will introduce me to the
<ce>        world of the craftsmen and the mechants, who will
<ce>        show me the path of success?

Message:  1013
<ce>        Oh, drat. I do thank you for coming to meet me
<ce>        at least. Now I know to look for someone else.
<ce>        Thank you, and %god watch over you this year.

Message:  1014
<ce>        And your answer, precisely as I hoped! Oh, what
<ce>        a thrill this is! I have my belongings ready. I have
<ce>        informed my butler to send out the circulars so soon
<ce>        as I leave town, so I have great reason to assume
<ce>        we will soon locate a suitable match for me.
<ce>        I will trust your judgment, knowing all the wiles and
<ce>        concerns of the complex adult world. Send me to
<ce>        whosoever you will, and I will dedicate myself to
<ce>        their cause. Let us go!

%qdt:
 _kid_, a well-behaved orphan,
 has asked me to find him a proper
 home where he can mature and learn
 the trades of the world. We will travel
 until that time, or perhaps until he gets bored.

Message:  1042
 To the orphan _kid_,
 
 My name is _smith_. My family and I
 are hard-working and honest weaponsmiths, bearing
 the family line for centuries past. We read of your
 request and believe ourselves to be suitable tutors
 in your desires to face the world with courage.
 We will teach you quality blacksmithing, haggling,
 travel, and accountability for your actions. Should
 we be in agreement, I and my family will await
 you with great anticipation.

Message: 1043
<ce>        A broad smile crests _smith_'s face.
<ce>        
<ce>        "Welcome, my fine visitors, to _wshop_!
<ce>        _kid_, I am certain, yes? A pleasure to
<ce>        meet you, lad. I meant all that I wrote and wish
<ce>        to show you how to enter the world of a real
<ce>        man. Do not worry for those twigs at your side,
<ce>        for within a year's time you will have strength
<ce>        enough to bend iron itself at your pleasure.
<ce>        And as for you, %ra, I wish to offer you this
<ce>        _weapon_ as payment for your travels, which
<ce>        I believe to be fair payment. Do we have a deal?"
<ce>        
<ce>        _kid_ looks slightly uncomfortable
<ce>        at the loud noise and rough demeanor present in this
<ce>        store. He sees the value in it but doesn't look entirely
<ce>        committed. Nevertheless, he said he would trust your
<ce>        judgment. Will you commit him to _smith_?

Message:  1044
<ce>        "Then that is a pity beyond my power to express, %ra.
<ce>        Be away with both of you, then. I have work to be doing."

Message:  1045
<ce>        You shake _smith_'s hand, bringing
<ce>        another broad smile to his face.
<ce>        
<ce>        "I assure you that you've made a fine choice.
<ce>        My word and my integrity are as valuable as
<ce>        my own soul, and I will raise and teach this child
<ce>        as one of my own. As I stated, I have this _weapon_
<ce>        as an adoption fee of sorts, if we will call it that.
<ce>        Take it and trust me and my family, for we will do right."
<ce>        
<ce>        You gesture to _kid_ to take his place as the
<ce>        weaponsmith hands you the _weapon_.

Message:  1051
<ce>        A small and dirty child, likely incapable of speech,
<ce>        hands _kid_ a note and totters off.

Message:  1052
 To the boy _kid_,
 
 We write to you in hopes that you will hear our
 plea. My family and I are not favored with
 material things as you may be used to, and
 we wish to state that first of all. Our labor is
 any that we can accumulate to keep ourselves
 fed and sheltered. We know you keep an
 inheritance from which you live, that which
 descended from your parents. If you will bring
 it to us and join yourself to our family, we will
 make you our guardian and appoint you over all
 our financial matters. We will entrust ourselves
 to you. Certainly no academic education can
 exceed the learning you will gain from us.
 I will await you in ___phouse_, under
 the roof lent to us for this season.

                _phouse_, ___phouse_

Message:  1053
<ce>        _poor_ generates a smell that _kid_
<ce>        reacts to poorly. He is clearly well out of his
<ce>        element here. Your host vigorously shakes your hands.
<ce>        
<ce>        "Well met, _kid_! It causes me shame
<ce>        to speak of such matters as these, but I bared
<ce>        my soul in my letter and made clear our situation.
<ce>        We need such money as you have. I do not have
<ce>        such tact or talent that you grew up with,
<ce>        and I do not hope to convince you if you are
<ce>        not already certain. But as a family we are
<ce>        close-knit, forgiving, and dedicated to our mutual
<ce>        well-being. These are things you will not learn
<ce>        in a bank or a guild. That I know! I have nothing to
<ce>        offer your guide as an adoption fee except my most
<ce>        express promise that we will raise you to be a proper
<ce>        adult, surrounded by integrity and the best of wishes."
<ce>        
<ce>        _kid_ looks bemused, to say the least.
<ce>        Still, he said he would trust you. Do you
<ce>        entrust him to _poor_?

Message:  1054
<ce>        "I have to ask, what did you come here for?
<ce>        To laugh at the poverty you knew you would
<ce>        find? Have your comedy then, and leave."

Message:  1055
<ce>        _poor_ embraces you joyfully, unpleasant
<ce>        as the experience is. _kid_ receives
<ce>        of the same kind of treatment.
<ce>        
<ce>        "Well, I suppose I should get used to it. This
<ce>        is my future, after all. I do not know what your
<ce>        plan is, but I do know to trust your judgment.
<ce>        Why else did I choose you, after all?"
<ce>         
<ce>        _kid_ sighs and begins unpacking his things, the
<ce>        first of which being a small pouch he hands to _poor_.
<ce>        
<ce>        "This is a handful of gold. With it, we first buy some
<ce>        bathing water and a cleansing agent for your whole
<ce>        family. Then I insist you take me about and show
<ce>        me this town. I will need to know the whereabouts
<ce>        if I will lift you out of poverty, for my money alone
<ce>        will not last a lifetime."
<ce>        
<ce>        As the conversation turns into a din, you take your leave.

Message:  1061
<ce>        A cloaked figure silently hands you a letter and marches away.

Message:  1062
 %pcf,
 
 We are informed you convey one _kid_ to
 look for a suitable family with which to build his future.
 We hope you will not forget that Brotherhood which
 serves all of Tamriel day and night. No greater family
 exists in all of ____dbhome_. Take heed to bring him
 to ___dbhome_. We will orient him in the ways
 of business, royalty, riches, and power as no other faction
 could ever dream of. Certainly you understand the value
 of our esteem, as well as an enchanted _mitem_
 from my personal store.

Message:  1063
<ce>        _db_ extends a solemn hand toward _kid_.
<ce>        
<ce>        "You have made the right choice, %ra. Our promises
<ce>        are sure. Turn the child over to us. One with his
<ce>        heritage and age has great potential to the Night Mother."
<ce>        
<ce>        _kid_'s eyes are wide open, and you think
<ce>        you see him shaking slightly. He apparently has
<ce>        no experience at all with the Dark Brotherhood.
<ce>        You will have to trust _db_ to orient him
<ce>        in its ways. Do you accept the offer?

Message:  1064
<ce>        "Fool! Why do you mock us so? Have we not shown
<ce>        you our secrets? Take this child away from here!
<ce>        Forget all that you have seen and heard! Now!"

Message:  1065
<ce>        You take _db_'s hand,
<ce>        and %g1 draws _kid_ near. 
<ce>        
<ce>        "There was only one choice after all, %pcf.
<ce>        I am pleased you did not hesitate. This day you
<ce>        have earned the attention of the Night Mother
<ce>        herself, which is no easy feat. She will know of
<ce>        you by name, and this child will be hers."
<ce>        
<ce>        _kid_'s brow furrows as he looks at you.
<ce>        He then puts his worries out of his mind,
<ce>        determined to learning this strange new world of
<ce>        crime and darkness. While _db_ makes small
<ce>        talk with him, %g1 pulls out the promised _mitem_
<ce>        and hands it to you before fully ignoring you.

Message:  1071
<ce>        A well-dressed page riding a steed offers you
<ce>        a letter and departs with a respectful bow.

Message:  1072
 _kid_,
 
 I have heard your story and wish to make you an offer.
 I am the owner of _bank_ in ___bank_.
 If you will join me, I will make of you one of the richest
 men in all of ____bank_ within ten years' time.
 Bring your inheritance and any adoption papers you will
 have me sign. I offer your escort =bankrew_ gold pieces
 for his or her trouble.
 
                _banker_

Message:  1073
<ce>        "Good. I'm glad to see you both well. Now, let's
<ce>        get down to business to make a man out of you."
<ce>        
<ce>        A steady and generally meaningless procession of
<ce>        business terms regarding loans, interests, repossession,
<ce>        and negotiation follows. _banker_ brings
<ce>        out maps of the city to show what properties are pending
<ce>        sale, as well as some lesser matters %g1 is watching.
<ce>        
<ce>        "_kid_, I will require you to invest the whole sum
<ce>        of your inheritance before I will accept you. In exchange,
<ce>        I promise you, with an ironclad guarantee, that you will
<ce>        bring forth a sum of no less than =dummymoney_ gold
<ce>        in the first year, which will duplicate in each succeeding
<ce>        year. Mark my words, for it will be done."
<ce>        
<ce>        _kid_ would certainly learn the adult world here, even if it
<ce>        were under the pressure of deadlines and negotiation.
<ce>        Do you accept _banker_'s offer of =bankrew_ gold pieces
<ce>        and give _kid_ to the care of _bank_?

Message:  1074
<ce>        _banker_ abruptly shuts the ledger and begins
<ce>        packing away the recently opened documents.
<ce>        
<ce>        "Go. Now. I do not care for you here."

Message:  1075
<ce>        You shake _banker_'s hand.
<ce>        
<ce>        "Fine. We have a room somewhere around here.
<ce>        You'll want to clean the dust off the bed before you
<ce>        sleep. Your first week's earnings will be sufficient
<ce>        to hire a servant girl, but until that time the chores will
<ce>        fall to you. Be ready for transactions no later than 7:45
<ce>        tomorrow morning. Every second client will be yours.
<ce>        Do what I do and say what I say. Do not vary from it."
<ce>        
<ce>        _banker_ nonchalantly brings out a sack of coins
<ce>        and hands it to you. _kid_ bows to you,
<ce>        mentally preparing himself for his new life.

Message:  1082
 _kid_,
 
 I'm writing to you on behalf of the Fighters Guild. We picked
 up one of the circulars you sent around, and we think we can
 take pretty good care of you. With us you'll learn combat,
 training, partnership, how to travel on your own, and how
 to work contracts and deadlines and such. At first you'll
 just be killing rats and scorpions and little critters like them,
 but it gets better after that. You'll have an honest living and
 learn to take care of yourself. You'll become a respectable
 young man working with us. Come see me in ___fguild_
 if that's an attractive offer. I can offer your escort
 =fgrew_ gold pieces as an adoption fee.

Message:  1083
<ce>        "Ah, great! Welcome, %pcf. And you're _kid_!
<ce>        I think you've got what it takes to start with us.
<ce>        I can at least justify it if you're good at running
<ce>        or jumping or swimming or something. In any case,
<ce>        they bend the rules a bit more if you start young.
<ce>        You're gonna have to learn to live in common quarters
<ce>        like what we've got upstairs, so take that into account.
<ce>        You're gonna live like us, act like us, talk like us, everything.
<ce>        No wimping out and sleeping in an inn from now on.
<ce>        We'll make you tough. That sound like a good deal to you?"
<ce>        
<ce>        _kid_ considers it thoughtfully. He doesn't appear
<ce>        to have any serious objection to staying here, though
<ce>        he's likely to spend most of his time as a follower
<ce>        rather than a leader. Do you accept the Fighters Guild's
<ce>        offer of =fgrew_ gold pieces and give him to their care?

Message:  1084
<ce>        "Oh, man! I was practicing that speech for days. Well, I guess
<ce>        that's it, then. Good luck looking for your new family.
<ce>        The Fighters Guild isn't for everyone, I know that."

Message:  1085
<ce>        _fg_ beams at your response.
<ce>        
<ce>        "All right then, it's settled! Welcome to the Fighters Guild,
<ce>        _kid_! You're one of us now. I'll take you to see our
<ce>        trainer tomorrow. She's gonna teach you what a _weapon_ is.
<ce>        You'll need to know how to swing it, 'cause next week
<ce>        we're sending you on your first assignment. It's probably
<ce>        gonna be something here in ___fguild_, like killing a bear
<ce>        or what have you. Who knows what it's gonna be. But just
<ce>        do what we say and you'll make it through just fine."
<ce>        
<ce>        _fg_ then hands you your payment. A pat on the
<ce>        back assures you that the Fighters Guild appreciates
<ce>        your bringing _kid_ here. The two wave to
<ce>        you and prepare for their first joint training session.
