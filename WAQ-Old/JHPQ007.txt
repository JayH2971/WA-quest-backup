<ce>        Nice work, %ra. It's a shame about our
<ce>        friend, but we've got a back-up plan worked
<ce>        out. Have a bit of money for your trouble.

<ce>        Angry shouts roar up behind you. A lithe
<ce>        figure presses a small bag into your hands
<ce>        while passing by, only managing to say
<ce>        in a harsh whisper,
<ce>
<ce>        "_qg_ in ___place_. Hurry."
<ce>
<ce>        Do you put the object into your bag?

Message:  1011
<ce>        With one swift movement you sink it into the 
<ce>        bottom of your pack and watch as %g1 runs
<ce>        away. The shortening distance suggests
<ce>        the chase is about to end. Once you're left 
<ce>        alone, you notice the bag contains a small
<ce>        amount of _subs_.

Message:  1013
<ce>       You let the item slip out of your hands and drop
<ce>       to the ground. One of the armed pursuers stops
<ce>       to pick it up and speak to you.
<ce>
<ce>       "Thank you for not helping %g2. We'll catch that
<ce>       pond scum within the hour. Leave it to us."
<ce>
<ce>       The warrior rushes off to catch up to
<ce>       the others, and you are left alone.
