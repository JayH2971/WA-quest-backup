<ce>                The harpies' hunters have been slain.
<ce>    One of them calls to you.
<ce>    
<ce>    "Our fullest gratitude to this %ra creature.
<ce>  May nature bow itself to your will."

Message:  1010

<ce>  be fleeing something, but in their panic,
<ce>  they see you as another threat.

Message:  1011
<ce>         A flock of harpies screeches nearby. They seem to
<ce>  be fleeing something. You call out in their language
<ce>  and receive a startled response.
<ce>  
<ce>  "You speak as we do?! Help us! Hunters follow
<ce>  and try to kill us!"
<ce>  
<ce>  Do you help defend the harpies?

Message:  1012
<ce>  "Worthless! Or are you just here to delay us?!"
<ce>  
<ce>  The harpies direct their rage to you.

Message:  1013
<ce>  In short order a group of humans
<ce>  catches up to the harpies.
<ce>  You make clear that the hunt is over.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Ha! And who is this %ra that tries to
<ce>  stop the lot of us? Pickings just got
<ce>  richer boys, have at it!"

Message:  1014
<ce>  The humans are dead, but so are the harpies.
<ce>  You did what you could, at least.
